<desc>The F-17 Condor is the primary Xenonaut interceptor aircraft, a general purpose dogfighter derived from the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Condor's Autocannon makes it well-suited to destroying smaller craft, whilst it also carries Sidewinder light missiles to make it a credible threat to medium-size vessels.&#10;&#10;The Condor has broadly similar performance to its parent aircraft but uses a modified airframe built from a titanium / magnesium alloy that gives the interceptor a reduced payload, but significantly longer range and improved durability. The alterations to the airframe have been made based on our studies of F-4 Phantoms damaged during the Iceland Incident. Components containing titanium or magnesium appeared to sustain less damage than those made of aluminium or other materials, suggesting some inherent resistance to alien energy weapons. We hope this reinforced airframe will make our Condors more capable against alien UFOs than interceptors from conventional air forces. &#10;&#10;The increased range is believed necessary - we have rather a lot of planet to protect. This has reduced the payload of the Condor, but it is still able to carry two light missiles and a craft cannon. This is a versatile combination; Sidewinder missiles have been proved effective and reliable against human aircraft, but we do not even know if we will be able to get a missile lock on alien vessels. The cannon has a shorter range and fires powerful shells that should be useful in a dogfight. One of the two weapons should hopefully prove effective against an enemy vessel.</desc>
<cdesc>F-17 “神鹰”是一种由F-16 “战隼”改进而来的多用途近距格斗战机，为Xenonaut 的初配主力截击飞行器。“神鹰”的机炮非常适合消灭小型目标，它还搭载了“响尾蛇”轻型导弹，能对中型战舰造成可观伤害。&#10;&#10;“神鹰”与其前辈机型的性能大体相当，但结构用钛镁合金改良，在降低负载能力的代价下显著提升了航程和机体耐久。改造机体是因为在对冰岛事件中的受损F-4 “鬼怪”研究后，发现含钛或镁元素的部件似乎比用铝和其他材料制成的部件对外星能量武器更有抗性。我们希望这种改良机体使“神鹰”能在对抗外星UFO时比传统空军的截击机发挥更好的作用。&#10;&#10;航程是必须加长的 - 毕竟我们有太多的土地需要保护。尽管这降低了“神鹰”的负载，但依然够使其携带两枚轻型导弹和一挺机炮。这种通配是用来应付多种情况的；因为“响尾蛇”导弹虽然已被证明对人类飞行器有效，但我们依然不清楚其是否能够成功锁定外星飞船。机炮则装备了大威力短程弹药，以期能在近距格斗中发挥作用。这样在遇敌之后，“神鹰”至少还能有一种有效武器来与之对抗</cdesc>
